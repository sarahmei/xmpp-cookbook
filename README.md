Chef Recipe for Erlang, Ejabberd & Friends
==========================================

A chef recipe to get erlang, ejabberd, poco, and cumulus set up for development work. Intended for use on OS X.
May accidentally work on other *nixes.

Cumulus recipe currently doesn't work - this may mean cumulus just doesn't install on OS X. TBD.

Based on jdiseno's highly useful [recipe for erlang and ejabberd](https://github.com/jdeseno/erlang-ejabberd-chef-cookbooks).

To setup on a local box, install [Soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) 
`gem install soloist`, then run `soloist` from this project's directory.
